        <h2>Donate to the Texas A&M Sailing Team</h2>
        <p>We have two options available for online donations through the Texas A&M Foundation. The first is to donate
            to our main account and support our daily operations (through the link on the left). The second is to donate
            to our endowment fund and support our future growth as an organization.</p> <br>
        <p>Thank you for your continued support of Texas A&M Sailing and for helping us to further our mission.</p><br>
