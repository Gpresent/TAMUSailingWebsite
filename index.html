            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p>
                The Texas A&M Sailing Team is dedicated to bringing the sport of sailing to the students of Texas A&M.
                Our
                team competes in the Intercollegiate Sailing Association (ICSA), and is one of the few Regionally-ranked
                teams in the Southeast region of ICSA. Our goal is to be a nationally-competitive sailing team and to
                create
                a culture of love for the sport sailing.
            </p> <br>
            <p>
                Our team was founded in 1990 and practices on Lake Bryan, a small lake about 20 minutes away from the
                A&M
                campus.
